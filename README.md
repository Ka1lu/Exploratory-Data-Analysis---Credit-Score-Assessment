# Credit Score Assessment - Exploratory Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** of credit score data, identifying patterns, correlations, and insights that can help in understanding factors affecting credit scores.  
The analysis examines relationships between various financial behaviors and credit scores across multiple customer records.

## Key Insights

### Credit Score Distribution
- **Standard**: ~53%  
- **Poor**: ~29%  
- **Good**: ~18%  

### Top Factors Affecting Credit Score
- **Credit Utilization Ratio** â†’ Lower utilization correlates with better scores  
- **Payment Behavior** â†’ Consistent payment behavior leads to better scores  
- **Credit History Age** â†’ Longer credit history correlates with better scores  
- **Delay from Due Date** â†’ Fewer days of delay correlates with better scores  

**Summary:** Customers with good credit scores typically maintain **low utilization**, a **longer history**, and **consistent on-time payments**.
